# Information Choice Batch Script - Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policy for the "Information Choice Batch Script." The script provides a menu-driven interface for users to access various system-related information. This policy aims to ensure secure usage and handling of sensitive information.

## User Input Validation

The script incorporates user input validation to prevent unintended behavior. It checks for valid input (numeric choices between 1 and 4) and handles invalid input gracefully, guiding the user back to the menu.

```batch
if "%choice%"=="1" (
    call :SystemInformation
) else if "%choice%"=="2" (
    call :DiskSpace
) else if "%choice%"=="3" (
    call :NetworkInformation
) else if "%choice%"=="4" (
    echo Exiting...
    exit /b 0
) else (
    echo Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 4.
    timeout /nobreak /t 2 >nul
    goto menu
)
```

## Information Handling

### System Information (`:SystemInformation`)

- The script uses standard Windows commands (`systeminfo`, `wmic`, `ipconfig`) to retrieve system information.
- No sensitive or personal information is stored or transmitted.
- Information is displayed to the user within the Command Prompt.

### Disk Space (`:DiskSpace`)

- Disk space information is retrieved using the `wmic logicaldisk` command.
- The script only displays information; it does not modify or delete any data.
- No sensitive information is stored or transmitted.

### Network Information (`:NetworkInformation`)

- Network information is obtained using the `ipconfig /all` command.
- The script only displays network-related details; it does not modify network settings.
- No sensitive information is stored or transmitted.

## Security Measures

- The script does not request or handle personal user information.
- User interaction is limited to selecting predefined menu options.
- The script does not modify system settings or files.
- The script does not involve external dependencies or downloads.
- The batch file is provided in source form to enable users to inspect the code for transparency.

## User Responsibilities

- Users should only run batch files from trusted sources.
- Ensure that the system environment is secure and free from malicious scripts.
- Adhere to security best practices when running scripts with administrative privileges.
